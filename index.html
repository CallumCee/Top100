								<h3>2009</h3>
								<p>Battlefield 1943 hit during the rise of Xbox Live Arcade and was one of the first ‘downloadable games’ to get it right. Each map was wonderfully crafted and with car, tank, boat, plane and on-foot action all happening alongside each other the result was a more fast-paced & condensed battlefield experience than the mainline games could offer. It also launched for only £10 which meant it was affordable enough for the majority of people to pick up close to launch, allowing for constantly full lobbies and fast search times. The game mostly sticks out to me though purely for the great memories I made playing in a squad with my friends- crashing planes into objective buildings, firing tank shells at friendly vehicles and ramping the speed boats directly onto the shore and as far onto land as possible.</br></p>

								<h3>1997</h3>
								<p>I’d imagine most people’s experience of Time Crisis would come from the arcade version usually found at the old <i>Hollywood bowl </i>but the majority of my Time Crisis 2 experience came from the 2001 Playstation 2 release. In a time before the eyetoy and the nintendo wii there weren’t many novel and exciting experiences like using the physical ‘guncon’ controller to point and shoot at the screen in order to kill enemies (primitive and dodgy tracking aside). Time Crisis 2 also provided me with one of the first memorable ‘co-op’ gaming experiences, playing through the campaign together with my dad (rather poorly) where the later levels in particular were frantic enough to remaining fairly challenging without being frustrating. The game also leans heavily into an almost anime style cast of characters such as personal favourite <i>Wild Dog</i>, a man with a gatling-gun in place of a prosthetic arm.</br></p>

								<h3>2007</h3>
								<p>Unreal Tournament 3 was my introduction to the franchise and having been a console gamer until just after I picked this up on Playstation 3, it was also my introduction to ‘arena shooters’ in general. Fantastic visuals, fast paced gameplay and a great selection of weapons that all have a unique feel as well as an associated playstyle. A constant dilemma of deciding whether to focus on rushing to the map objective, trying to gain control of the power weapon spawns or just trying not to get killed every 20 seconds by <i>that guy</i> who’s clearly been playing since Unreal back in 1998. It also houses one of the best ‘capture the flag’ variants with a fantastic set of maps focused around keeping life in a game-mode that so many other games have seemingly left behind. Also, how fucking cool is the flak cannon?. </br></p>

								<h3>2017</h3>
								<p>Most likely a beneficiary of recency bias on longer reflection but ‘Golf It!’ is just pure fun. It’s amazing to me that it’s taken until 2017 to produce a memorable mini-golf game (with a slight nod to 1998’s Rugrats: Search for Reptar, which had a great mini-golf level) but this ticks all the boxes. It’s about as simple as you would expect mechanic-wise for a mini-golf game but most importantly it comes with a fantastic set of tools for creating custom content. This has lead to hours of fun with friends playing all kinds of different levels, from a realistic 18-hole golf course to an inspired recreation of the first Harry Potter movie. It really is the embodiment of a relaxing good time.</br></p>

								<h3>2016</h3>
								<p>Oxenfree oozes style with some fantastic visual art and an atmospheric soundtrack that manages to ground this rather bizarre supernatural narrative. The characters, all young adults, are written convincingly and the dialogue flows very well between them with a choice-driven speech system that focuses on allowing a realistically paced conversation without having to ‘pause’ the world around them for a static back-and-forth. The atmosphere throughout the game is very unsettling which adds to the character interaction and story beats without having to descend into cheap jump-scares to evoke player reaction. There is also multiple endings for the game which do provide some weight for the choices you make along the way and is a reminder that maybe paying slightly more attention to those <i>other</i> characters you aren’t quite vibing with could be beneficial. And if nothing else the OST is an experience in itself, seriously.</br></p>

								<h3>2015</h3>
								<p>Emily is Away is a very short experience that trades largely off nostalgia but despite that stuck with me way longer than most. The game managed to strike so many chords with me and parts of the narrative were so eerily similar to my own experiences that it felt like it was written about me. Although in saying that I was clearly not the only angst-filled teen wasting away my days on MSN messenger as Emily is Away portrays them all too well. Having strange conversations, flirting poorly with others, spending far too long deciding which song lyrics to include in your display name- all of which are well represented here. The story itself won't come close to winning any oscars but it does feel incredibly personal and true-to-life. There’s also just a great amount of enjoyment to be had looking through all the 8-bit representations of album artwork from the early 2000’s.</br></p>

								<h3>2018</h3>
								<p>Detroit: Become Human is the latest narrative adventure game from Quantic Dream. It’s worth noting upfront that David Cage games have to be enjoyed in a certain way. Meaning that often times the writing and narrative can be rather obnoxious, stumbling and frankly- fairly problematic. So if you’re looking to enjoy any of his work you really have to embrace the stupidity of it all and try not to take any of it too seriously. That aside though, Detroit is often at its strongest when it’s at its most ridiculous. The back and forth between the characters, especially in the case of Connor and Hank, is wonderfully done. The game throughout has great voice acting, amazing facial animation through face-capture and is beautifully framed throughout in a movie-like fashion. The story itself also features three playable characters that you jump back-and-forth between with enough branching paths to keep you on your feet throughout. The paths are also displayed in very interesting grid-like fashion that provides an incentive to play through each sequence multiple times (if not only because you fucked up the quick-time event and killed off a named character).</br></p>

								<h3>2010</h3>
								<p>Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is, for my money, the pinnacle of the series. The multiplayer was designed to accommodate smaller squad sizes which lead to more intense skirmishes and tactical battles, the maps were also a lot more intricate and thought-out which meant the matches had a better flow to them and the sound design was one of the first that could be described as phenomenal with the implementation of proper directional audio and booming bass where appropriate. But most importantly, the frostbite engine allowed for unprecedented levels of environmental destruction which almost always resulted in sections of the map looking somewhat unrecognisable by the end of the round. Later battlefield games decided to focus more on massively scripted set piece destructions, which were fairly cool when you saw them the first few times but didn’t provide me with a feeling that came close to the moment in Bad Company 2 where you got so annoyed by <i>that </i>sniper camping in the window that you literally took the building from underneath them.</br></p>

								<h3>2014</h3>
								<p>There’s a lot of phrases you could use to describe Jazzpunk but if I had to pick one the most appropriate would probably be ‘what the fuck?’. Jazzpunk is a first-person adventure game that has you controlling the player character through a series of strange nonsensical events under the guise of working for a detective agency, I think? The overarching story really isn’t that important though as the joy of Jazzpunk is predominantly found in the moment-to-moment. Absurdist humour, deadpan one-liners, art-style changes that border on the ridiculous and a number of sequences that can only be described as <i>genuinely funny</i>. It’s a wild ride from start to finish and a truly unique experience worth at least trying out to see if the humour clicks.</br></p>

								<h3>2010</h3>
								<p>The third entry in the God of War series again see’s the return of Kratos, and boy is he angrier than ever. God of War 3 is hack and slash at its best- a large scale, wonderfully rendered environment serves as the backdrop to this 10-or-so hour murder extravaganza that has you mashing away at a number of different creatures with a variety of different weapons. As with previous God of War games the camera is placed perfectly to give you a clear view of the action as well as providing a great sense of scale to the battles and bosses throughout. A good selection of upgrades keeps the weapons feeling fresh and allows for more thought-out combos to keep the gameplay loop satisfying. The ending of the game also manages to knock Kratos out of his anger-loop to pause for a moment of self-reflection which is fairly novel in itself and sets up 2018’s God of War fittingly (which, at the time of writing, I have unfortunately not yet beaten).</br></p>

Although I’ve clocked over 100 hours in this game I still feel as though I haven’t fully gotten to grips with the gameplay and honestly I’m <i>pretty fucking bad</i> at this game, yet I keep coming back to it. The real reason this game makes the list is because it managed to grip me purely through watching it being played professionally by others, or <i>e-sports</i>, if you like. It is the perfect game for viewing. The gameplay from the outset is simplistic enough to clearly understand for first-time viewers but has so many layers of strategy and depth that manages to reward both good-teamwork and excellent individual plays- something you rarely get from any other competitive game. The maps involved are expertly crafted and instantly memorable to the point where there won’t be many people that couldn’t map you at least a portion of de_dust2 from memory. I also find joy in collecting the weapon skins for guns I like, so there’s always that factor to keep me returning (help me).</br></p>

								<h3>1999</h3>
								<p>Theme Park World (or sim theme park in the US) is a charming theme park management simulator and served as the gateway for my childhood love of amusement parks. The game presents you with four different worlds to play, each containing their own custom rides, cartoonish scenery and associated difficulty level. The progression of the game is more focused on the business management aspect of theme parks than rides themselves but that didn’t stop me from spending hours upon hours building different roller-coaster tracks in order to ‘ride’ them from a first-person perspective, which was notably novel at the time. And who can forget the genius of setting up a ‘french fries’ stand, turning the salt levels to maximum and the price to cheap and then setting up a drinks stand right next to it with the price maxed out- a primitive business plan befitting of the time.</br></p>

								<h3>1999</h3>
								<p>I’ve always continually tried to get into different real-time strategy games but quickly seem to bounce off of them but with Age of Empires II it’s easy to lose track of what day it is mid-way through a single game. There is something that is just inherently <i>cool</i> about Age of Empires- large scale battles, knights, siege weaponry, castles, warships, wonders of the world. Even years later all of these hold up perfectly and the game is just as fun as it ever was. With the HD update and following expansion the game also has new life in online play, well designed custom scenarios and the addition of even more civilizations to play. And even if you’re not any good at the game there is still plenty of fun to be found such as: creating an army of farmers and charging them all together at the enemy base, running random villagers to hidden sections of the map to frustrate the life out of your opponents towards the end-game and my personal favourite of spamming ‘Wololo’ in the chat over and over until everyone is thoroughly annoyed.</br></p>

								<h3>2014</h3>
								<p>The Jackbox Party Pack, and its further four iterations, provide you with a great collection of games to play- each with their own fun quirks. But the main strength of the pack itself lies in its facilitation of these games and the ease of access it provides to have a great amount of fun for a variety of different people. The barrier to entry is vastly lower than other ‘party’ style games that came before it, doing away with the need for multiple expensive controllers or the logical nightmare that accompanied passing around a single controller. A smart phone is all that’s needed to join the game, with the accompanied UI making it as intuitive as possible even for the ‘non-gamers’ in the group. The core joy of Jackbox depends largely on the people you’re playing with, as a game with your family will always veer in a different direction to that with your friends, but the game remains flexible enough to handle both scenarios. You are rewarded for your knowledge level of each player and your ability to tap into their specific type of humour will dictate your success. It’s like if ‘Cards Against Humanity’ was actually fun.</br></p>

								<h3>2013</h3>
								<p>Beyond: Two souls is the second David Cage associated entry on the list, and comes with some of the same caveats as mentioned in Detroit: Too Human. The narrative focuses around a single character, Jodie (portrayed brilliantly by Ellen Page) and her supernatural link to her stillborn brother Aiden which has granted her other-wordly skills (such as Telekinesis). The main plot of the game is similarly bizarre, presenting a wild ride of different events in Jodies life from her childhood to her mid-twenties all in a jumbled non-chronological order. There’s always <i>something</i> going on to keep you amused and engaged. The real shine of the game becomes apparent in the quieter moments spent with Jodie where the voice acting, rendering, animation and direction all come together to produce some wonderfully emotional moments that resonate even aside the supernatural silliness the rest of the world is presenting.</br></p>

								<h3>2017</h3>
								<p>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is the first standalone expansion for the Uncharted series and the first not to feature poster-boy Nathan Drake, yet it manages to stand as out one of the most memorable entries in the series. The dynamic between protagonists Nadine and Chloe is both vastly enjoyable and a refreshing break from the usual Drake-isms of the last four entries. Both characters have personalities that play well off of each other, allowing you to really understand their respective backgrounds as well as providing many humorous moments. The visuals are very much on par with what you’d expect from an Uncharted game, boasting stunning environments, great visual fidelity and showpiece lighting as well as industry topping character animation and voice acting. I’ll also give a shout-out to the great collection of puzzles throughout the game, which are my favourites of the whole series and a further shoutout to Sully whose absence left a notable sadness, unlike that of Nathan Drake’s.</br></p>

								<h3>2014</h3>
								<p>One place down and another standalone expansion, this time in the form of The Last of Us: Left Behind. The main narrative of Left Behind follows Ellie before the events of the Last of Us alongside friend and love-interest Riley. The experience itself is fairly short but still manages to pack in a tonne of great character interaction and action sequences. Ellie and Riley have a great relationship throughout and the dialogue presented both in cutscenes and in-gameplay is written in such a natural way that leads to a very believable connection between the characters. There are various somber and emotional moments that give a lot more context to the character of Ellie and her motivations to come as well as some genuinely joyful moments, such as the water-gun fight at the department store, providing a nice tone change to an otherwise bleak world. The action sequences also encourage more thought and careful planning than those in the main game as Ellie’s diminutive frame rules out the more brash approach Joel could adopt. This leads you to interact with the world more and creates situations where you can use both environmental hazards and manipulation of the infected A.I to wipe out all of an areas enemies without being spotted. And with The Last of Us 2 on the horizon who didn’t want more Ellie?</br></p>

								<h3>2016</h3>
								<p>Titanfall 2 is a fast-paced first person shooter that rewards clever mobility as much as good aim. The game itself is largely built and focused around its multiplayer but the reason this game makes it anywhere near my list is the fantastic single-player campaign. First person shooter campaigns are usually fairly lackluster and unimaginative in most cases and the original Titanfall didn’t even feature one at all, so it was a hell of a surprise to say the least. The campaign is split into 8 separate levels which all contain a different gameplay or environmental focus, whether it be the classic FPS jungle-shooter, massive mech battles or platforming through a simulation factory- each stage feels new and exciting. The level design is outstanding throughout and is best exemplified by the fifth mission ‘Effect and Cause’ which is amongst my favourite levels of any game. There is also a running narrative throughout the campaign which all together isn’t very memorable in itself but there are a charming cast of characters in the form of each levels end-boss as well as your sidekick mech companion 'BT' who really stole the show. </br></p>

								<h3>2013</h3>
								<p>Possibly the most niche entry on my list, Contrast is a game that isn’t roundly well known and wasn’t received all that well by the majority who played it due to a myriad of technical issues. Despite these issues it managed to leave a lasting impression with its beautiful film-noir aesthetic and awesome character design, a wonderful jazz soundtrack (well worth a listen even in its own right) and the execution of the games 3D to 2D platforming puzzles. You control Dawn, an Imaginary friend of young girl Didi, who can transport at will between the ‘real’ world and the ‘shadow’ world. This leads to many fantastic sequences where you can manipulate objects and lighting in the 3D game-world to allow for solid ground to platform with in the 2D shadow world. This creative concept allows the story to play out presenting only Dawn and Didi in the 3D world and the rest of the cast as shadows, creating some artistically profound moments as you traverse physically along the break-up of Didi’s parents as they argue- well, if you didn’t get stuck in the wall of course.</br></p>

								<h3>2015</h3>
								<p>There’s a hell of a lot of zombie games, <i>too</i> many zombie games, so naturally when Dying Light released in 2015 I soundly ignored it. Luckily for me, I had exhausted every other online co-op game I could think of at the time so a full campaign co-op experience was greatly welcomed and what followed completely blew me away. The zombies start out with a great feeling of weight to them where they are difficult enough to take on where you’ll want to avoid them where possible while not feeling completely unsurmountable if you do get attacked. The open-world environment is fantastically varied with many large open areas as well as densely packed cities with a tonne of verticality that allows you to make use of the great parkour and traversal mechanics featured. There is also a great difficulty curve that runs throughout the game, especially during the worlds night-time portions that see special zombie variants roam the world that arise the need to undertake a more stealthy approach- or just absolutely leg it to the nearest safe-zone landmark in site. The skill tree also means that the more you play the better your character becomes with an increase in damage levels, killing abilities, traversal abilities and even the introduction of a grappling hook which always kept the gameplay engaging throughout the length of the campaign. I should also mention that the plot isn’t great but that’s the brilliance of playing in co-op- always having a friend handy to share a laugh at the stupidity of it all.</br></p>
