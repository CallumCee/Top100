								<h3>2014</h3>
								<p>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an open-world, third-person action-adventure by Monolith Productions, set in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings universe. The game is set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, just as Sauron begins to return to his former strength and search for the One Ring. At this point in history, Mordor is a dangerous place, but not yet a barren wasteland; plants and animals live there, as well as a small population of humans.</p></br>

								The player takes control of a ranger named Talion, who along with his family is killed by servants of Sauron. However, Talion is brought back to life, his spirit now tied to a wraith who bears a mysterious connection to him, and has its own motives. The story follows Talion's journey into Mordor to exact revenge for his family's murder, aided by the wraith's spectral powers.</p>

								<h3>2005</h3>
								<p>Tony Hawk's American Wasteland is not a continuation of the story found in the Underground tiles, but features a brand new one. Unlike previous Tony Hawks, the main feature boasted by THAW is that the entire game would take place in one giant streaming level, a interpretation of Los Angeles. The story has the player's created skater arriving in LA after the realization that his Mid-Western home is no place for a skater (THAW has players pick between five pre-made male characters to take through story mode). Once there, he meets a wide array of characters/pro skaters and eventually takes on the task of rebuilding the 'Wasteland' Skate Ranch. The story is told through in-game cinematics similar to the Underground games, and drawings by artist Jimbo Philips.</p></br>

								Story progression works just as it did in the Underground games. Players are asked to complete story related goals to help them unlock a new area or a piece for the skate ranch. During story mode, goals would include pulling a trick off a certain object found throughout the virtual LA. This would cause "World Destruction" scenes similar to Underground 2, and that piece would disappear from the level and be incorporated into the skate ranch.</p>

								<h3>2007</h3>
								<p>The sequel to Unreal Tournament 2004, Unreal Tournament 3 brings the fast-paced arena-based gameplay to Epic's Unreal Engine 3 game engine. Along with a revamp of both aesthetics and gameplay, the game features customizable characters, new game modes, new vehicles, and a story-based campaign mode.</p></br>

								Unlike previous games, the main campaign does not follow the Liandri Grand Tournament. Set in the year 2307, four years after the events of Unreal Tournament 2004, the story follows a band of survivors after their human colony was invaded by Krall forces (which was quickly discovered to be led by the Necris High Inquisitor Akasha). After joining the Izanagi Corporation as mercenaries (under the codename "Ronin"), the team (led by James "Reaper" Hawkins) works against Izanagi's rivals (Liandri and Axon) to gather resources for their payback against the Necris. It is the first game in the series to use the concepts of "Respawners" and "Field Lattice Generators" (or "FLAGS") to explain the universe's combat outside of a tournament scenario.</p>

								<p>Set in a noir art deco atmosphere, the player controls Dawn, a little girl's imaginary friend, who is able to move in 3D or become a 2D shadow on the wall, where she can use existing shadows as platforms. There is control over different light sources in the 3D world (spotlights, film projectors, etc) to create the proper shadow paths in the 2D world to let her reach different areas in the 3D world.</p></br>

								There are two main characters, Didi, a young girl, and Dawn (the player character), Didi's imaginary friend, a woman dressed as an acrobat who has superhuman strength and magical shadow abilities. Didi has a dysfunctional family, since her mother Kat is a cabaret singer who is forced to spend nights away from her daughter, and her estranged father, Johnny, is always going after get-rich-quick schemes and breaking his promises. When Didi sneaks out of the house at night, Dawn must use her powers to help her make things better for her family, to make a reconciliation between her parents possible.</p>

								<p>Jazzpunk is a stylized first-person adventure comedy. As the mysterious Agent Polyblank, you’ll explore a variety of retro-futuristic locations, and perform all manner of gadget-driven capers. The tone of the game is cartoon cyberpunk; dense technology-infused locales, dripping with a fresh coat of colour and humour.</p></br>

								Each mission has one central objective, but the player is free to explore the game world at their own pace, which is populated with a large number of interactive NPCs, each with their own action or gag. Mini-games, including mini-golf, a Frogger clone, and a version of Duck Hunt in which the player pelts cardboard ducks with slices of bread from a toaster, also feature prominently in the game's storyline.</p>

								<h3>2016</h3>
								<p>Oxenfree is an adventure game akin to The Walking Dead and other choice-based experiences. The game revolves around Alex, her new step-brother Jonas, and friends Ren, Nona, and Clarissa. An annual get-together at Edward's Island yields deeper, darker mysteries for the group as Alex discovers she can tune in to the Island's history using a handheld radio. The group is split by the Island's cosmic forces, and the player is tasked with bringing everyone together and escaping the horrors of the past.</p></br>

								The player guides Alex, the blue-haired teenage protagonist, through hand drawn environments and tunes a handheld radio to uncover various mysteries across the island. The game's dialogue trees, which typically requires the player to choose one of three responses, will shape the group's feelings toward Alex as the player progresses through the game.</p>

								<h3>2013</h3>
								<p>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a critically-acclaimed adventure game by Starbreeze Studios. It was developed in collaboration with Swedish filmmaker Josef Fares, who internationally is best known for his film Zozo. It was the first release in the 2013 Summer of Arcade, hitting XBLA on August 7th, 2013.</p></br>

								The game revolves around two brothers, whose father is dying, and who can only be saved by a very unique and rare medicine in a far off land. The brothers decide to take action and venture on to save their father. Each of the brothers is controlled by one dual stick, which means that there is no switching between them, because both are being controlled at all times. The brothers can perform various unique interactions with things in the environment. The game's puzzles revolve mostly around traversal and the mechanics that come from the dual stick controls.</p>

								<p>Saints Row 2 is a crime-themed, mission-based, open world game developed by Volition and published by THQ. Saint's Row 2 has the player work his way through a vastly improved Stilwater, a 150% larger version of the city with new areas including a prison island, a power plant, suburbs, and some underground sections, dispensing of rival gang members and otherwise unruly denizens to reclaim the turf and respect his once lofty gang has lost.</p></br>

								Saints Row 2 picks up several years after the events of the first game. The Boss, the player's character who was thought to be dead at the end of the first game after being betrayed by his own gang members, awakes from a coma induced by a bombed yacht but is horribly disfigured. Upon returning to Stilwater, the lead character notices that much has changed, from building renovations that have added more high-rise buildings and apartments, to the situations that his old friends and gang members have gotten into. The player character must now deal with all of these changes and somehow restore the Row to its former glory.</p>

								<p>Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ, Minecraft and Stalker – Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources.</p></br>

								You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game, so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you, kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you – you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust’s world is harsh – so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you.</p>
