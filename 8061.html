								<h3>2007</h3>
								<p>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is an action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game follows Nathan Drake, a scruffy treasure hunter who claims to be a descendant of famous explorer Sir Francis Drake. The game begins as Drake recovers Sir Francis Drake's coffin from the ocean floor, though rather than finding a body, Nathan finds a diary chronicling Sir Francis Drake's adventures, confirming Nathan's suspicions that he faked his death to continue his search for the lost city of gold, El Dorado. Nathan and his weathered partner Sully use clues from Sir Francis Drake's diary to find El Dorado for themselves.</p></br>

								Like Tomb Raider, the gameplay in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune features platforming elements where Drake must navigate complex, puzzle-filled ruins. He can swim, jump, grab and move along ledges, climb, and swing from ropes. However, there's an even greater volume of combat in Uncharted, including both hand-to-hand combat and gunplay.</p>

								<h3>2016</h3>
								<p>Superhot is an independent first-person shooter video game developed and published by Superhot Team. Though the game follows traditional first-person shooter gameplay mechanics, with the player attempting to take out enemy targets using guns and other weapons, time within the game progresses only when the player moves; this creates the opportunity for the player to assess their situation and respond appropriately, making the gameplay similar to strategy video games. The game is presented in a minimalist art style, with enemies in red and weapons in black, in contrast to the otherwise white and grey environment.</p></br>

								SUPERHOT aims to finally add something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. See the bullets crawling towards you as you carefully plan your steps and aim your gun. Enjoy the mayhem that is unleashed as you put that plan into motion. Dodge bullets. Take out your enemies. One step at a time.</p>

								<p>Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure is a competitive skateboarding game developed by Toys for Bob and published by Activision. The game features Disney characters from The Lion King, Toy Story and Tarzan and follows the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater template, allowing players to combine grabs, flips and grinds and link them together with manuals. The courses are built to resemble areas from the corresponding movies, with the exception of the hub world Olleywood which is closer to a regular real-life skating park.</p></br>

								Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure utilized a free roam system. Goals were scattered throughout the various maps and could be attempted upon approach. A point system was also in place for performing tricks using objects in the environment. Outfits and other unlockables could be bought with stars earned by completing goals and challenges.</p>

The game went on to become Jiggmin's most successful project, receiving over 32 million plays on Kongregate alone and becoming one of the most popular Flash games of all time when it was released</p></br>

								Like its predecessor, Platform Racing 2 is an online side-scrolling racing game where players race and battle against each other on-foot with their own customizable avatar in user-created maps. Item blocks scattered around provide players with random items when bumped, which can give them an advantage over others depending on the level. As the maximum attainable speed as been drastically increased, gameplay is considerably faster paced than the original, allowing for more brisk matches that require greater skill to win.</p>

								<p>Thimbleweed Park is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick and published by Terrible Toybox. The game is a spiritual successor to Gilbert and Winnick's previous games Maniac Mansion and The Secret of Monkey Island. The game is played similarly to early graphic adventure games; it is seen from a third person perspective, with a view of the area taking up the majority of the screen, while the bottom portion is taken up by the player's inventory and a list of verbs, such as "use", "pick up", and "talk to". By clicking on a verb followed by one or two items or characters, the player character will attempt to perform the action described. </p></br>

								Thimbleweed Park is the curious story of two washed up federal agents called in to investigate a dead body found in the river just outside of town, bloated and pixelated from a death come too soon.</p>
